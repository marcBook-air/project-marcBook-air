#ASSESSMENT
##Code
- To make the code readable I have split up complex views in subviews.
- SwiftUI is sometimes difficult to understand, So I wrote my comment more like they where notes to myself, this is different from the common way of commenting code but I thing my way fits the purpose.
- I had to make a json databace for my project, so if you look in the resources map you can see the way I have formatted it. I have chosen this format because it improves readability.
- I have given my files, variables and functions clear names to improve findability and readability.
##interaction design
- For me it's important that an app feels natural, it has to work seamlessly. Seeing a white screen while the app is loading to start up gives not a seamless experience so I simple but beautiful launchscreen to give a more seamless experience.
- For me it's also impotent that the user gets feedback when something is happening in the app. For example look at the like button, when you tap it combines rotation, scaling and shadow effects to grab the users attention. The use knows that something must have happened and that is good user feedback.
- Simplicity is also something I appreciate in an app. This app is super simple, even a baby can use it. There are three taps to navigate and you can tap the pictures in every view to go to the details of the picture. It feels super natural to use.
- The app feels contestant because all the UI elements share the same design language. With design language i mean for example that every element has the same corner radius. 
##Repository and documentation
- My repository is complete and clean.
- I have all files divided into groups and in the group 'views' I even have sorted the files in groups of views that belong together.
- All my files have clear names to make them more findable.
- My documentation is clean and neat.
##Biggest decisions
There only is one if I'm honest. The biggest decision that I have made is to revisit my plans five days before the deadline. I could not make CloudKit work and in that moment you have to choose if your initial idea is worth the time and it just was not. I wanted to make that dating app but it was impossible to do without CloudKit. In the end I am pleased with the result that I have submitted but I have enrolled for an apple developers account because I still want to make my initial plan and now I can do that for my self in my own time.
