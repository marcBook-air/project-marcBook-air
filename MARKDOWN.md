## The problem
One of the most important things in social reletionships is having a common sence of humor. Unfortunately finding someone with the same kind of humor can turn out to be
quite difficult. The app humorly helps to solve this problem by creating a platform to build new relationships based on humor. 
## The solution
Humorly matches people based on shared kind of humor. This is how it works:  
When making an account the users will be asked to give a joke or quote that they think is funny. When using the app it works a lot like the app Tinder, the user gets continuously a quote or joke form another user and can swipe it right (if he finds it funny) or left (if he finds it not funny). If two users both like each other's joke there is a match. In the case of a match users will get each others contact information.
## Sketches
These are the sketches for the UI of the app:

## Prerequisites
### Data sources
For this project I will use Swift and SwiftUI also I need a server to store the account data of users for this I will use an apple API named [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/cloudkit).
### External components
Except from CloudKit I don't need other external components
### Similar apps
The most simular app is the app Tinder, in witch you swipe pictures to the left and right if you find someone atractive or not. The inner workings of Tinder are not public so i have can not use it to make this app.
### Hardest parts
The hardest part of the app is to make the "matching algoritm work".
