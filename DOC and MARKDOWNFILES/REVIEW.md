# Review
My review partner is Max Westerman. He gave me the following points:

  - On top of every file you can place a summary about the what the code does and in
which view the code is used. I didn't do this because I 
thought the functionnames, filenames, variablenames and the grouping of my files made this already very clear. But I have to admit that he has a valid point and I will do this different in the future.
