## Problems during the project
This project was not my original plan. Initial I wanted to make a sort of dating app, to do that i needed an API called CloudKit. The UVA gave me access to this API but it never worked well and I disconnected form the server very often and then the UVA had to reconnect me again. So on friday evening before the deadline I got disconnected completely form CloudKit, but my app was not ready because I missed two days of work due to the passing of my dog. So I was completely stuck and to be able to deliver a good project on time, I had to change my original plans. So this is way this app is so different from my initial plans.
